                <p>The Wilbur Wright Rams fight hard all game to take home their first win of the season on Nov. 8, as they improve to 1-2 on the year and 1-0 in conference play.


                    After playing two non-conference games to start the season, the Rams were back at Wright College for their third home game to start the season. 
                    
                    
                    The Truman Falcons looked to make it a third straight loss for the Rams, but strong play down the stretch made all the difference for the Rams to get their first win of the season.
                    
                    
                    “It was an exciting game,” coach Thomas said after his team pulled out a 71-70 win, “I knew If I wasn’t careful, I would get caught up in the emotions of the game, so I tried to stay as even-keeled as possible and continue to teach and coach my boys throughout this rollercoaster of a game.”
                    
                    
                    Thomas also acknowledged the team's relentless fight that started early in the game, “they kept fighting the whole game, no matter what happened, a couple calls didn’t go our way, it didn’t matter we just stayed locked in.”</p>
